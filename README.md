## Usage

Navigate to the [Code Gauntlet](https://code-gauntlet-3e9a71d036dd.herokuapp.com). Sign up or login and select your coding experience level. When you're ready to compete, you'll receive questions based on the difficulty level you selected. Copy the question into your own code editor and, when your think you've got it figured out, copy your solution back into the app to submit it! Then you'll be able to vote on other users submissions based on uniqueness, best practices, or Null (Which is our way of saying, "Hey, I wouldn't have done it that way, but it works!).

// DON'T FORGET SCREENSHOTS!!!
